In this challenge, you are required to implement inorder traversal of a tree.
Complete the  function in your editor below, which has  parameter: a pointer to the root of a binary tree. It must print the values in the tree's inorder traversal as a single line of space-separated values.

Solution
public static void inOrder(Node root) {
        if(root==null)return;
        inOrder(root.left);
        System.out.print(root.data + " ");
        inOrder(root.right);
    }
