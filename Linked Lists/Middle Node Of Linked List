Given a singly linked list of 'N' nodes. The objective is to determine the middle node of a singly linked list. However, 
if the list has an even number of nodes, we return the second middle node.

Solution : 
public class Solution
{
    public static Node findMiddle(Node head)
    {
        // Write your code here.
        if(head==null || head.next==null)return head;
        Node slow = head, fast = head;
        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null)
        {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
}
